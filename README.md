# Daylight Glare Measurement Using DGP

## Project Overview
The aim of this work was to design and implement a device for assessing daylight glare in interior
spaces. The project focuses primarily on the **Daylight Glare Probability (DGP)**
metric, which is one of the most significant indicators used for glare
evaluation.

The device is based on the **Raspberry Pi** platform, utilizing tools from
the **RADIANCE** software package, particularly the **Evalglare** program, which
was developed by the authors of the DGP metric.

The GitHub repository contains all source codes, scripts, and documentation
required to understand, reproduce, and use the measurement system.

## Practical Implementation
The practical part of the work focuses on:
- the design of a measurement device for glare evaluation using DGP,
- implementation of the device on the Raspberry Pi platform,
- acquisition of HDR images using a fisheye projection,
- evaluation of DGP using the **Evalglare** tool.

- **Fisheye camera** – acquisition of the full field of view  
- **RADIANCE** – lighting simulation and analysis software package  
- **Evalglare** – tool for computing DGP from HDR images  
- **Bash scripts** – automation of measurement and evaluation workflows
